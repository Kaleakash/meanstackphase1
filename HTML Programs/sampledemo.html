   <font color="red" size=5 face="Monotype corsiva">     Customer content is some of the most sought after information 
        from prospects to gauge the quality of your product and services</font>, 
        as well as the fit with their own organization.
    </p>

One of the easiest ways to build credibility is by displaying your customer
 logos on your website.  This offers easy visual brand recognition but 
 also lets a prospect know right away what other type businesses or 
 organizations are using the software (and how similar to his own company 
 they are).

The example below on Basecampâ€™s website demonstrates the use
 of logos that integrate nicely with their general design aesthetic.  
 The example also shows how logos and customer visuals lend to a nice 
 educational balance with relevant images compared to strictly text heavy
  website content.
